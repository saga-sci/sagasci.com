        <h2>Drone Targeting and Tracking Technology</h2>
        <p>Saga Scientific develops real-time embedded (RTE) systems for drone targeting and tracking with integrated decision-making. These systems fuse data from radar and cameras to distinguish drones from birds, aircraft, and vehicles. Radar time-series analysis identifies behavioral patterns in drones to predict trajectories and support interception planning.

        <h2>Image Recognition, GIS, and Decision Support Systems</h2>
        <p>The company's systems perform image recognition integrated with geographic information systems (GIS) for anomaly detection and decision support. They process inputs from videos, cameras, and other sensors to identify and annotate objects for operators. The systems also assess model risk levels and conduct root cause analysis for failures to maintain operational continuity.</p>
        <h2>Aerospace AI Research</h2>
        <p>Saga Scientific conducts research in aerospace AI, including sensor fusion for integrating data from multiple sources, adaptive controls that adjust in real time, and computer-aided design (CAD) for system integration. This research supports avionics, unmanned systems, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance applications.</p>
